                        What's there to say? I managed to get my generous CS department to pay for my spot on the Tiny Tapeout 2 program and within the 
                        <em>very</em> limited constraints of 8 input / 8 output and 150 x 170 Âµm die area fit a little processor inspired by the RISC-V ISA. I detailed
                        it all, with pictures and tables, over on the GitHub repo so go check it out: <a class="name" href="https://github.com/AidanGood/tt02-McCoy">tt02-McCoy</a>.

                        Later in 2023/2024 once it gets fabricated I can run some validation tests on it and enjoy the first custom piece of silicon I created.

                        Working in the Bucknell Advanced Analytics Research Lab, my primary focus was on measuring the impact pruning has on 
                        fairness in neural networks. I was first author on this paper, and it got accepted into the NeurIPS 2022 Conference. 
                        After that, I worked on a paper focused on exploring selective pruning based on linear regions in linear neural networks.
                        This paper got accepted into CPAIOR 2023. <br>

                        My first real foray into the world of FPGAs and hardware synthesis, two of my friends and I created a circuit that replicates 
                        the basics of the Dance Dance Revolution game: a directional arrow appears and you press on the corresponding directional button.
                        We used the Basys3 FPGA Board with Vivado software. Project features include VGA output, NES controller support, and 4 difficulty selections.

                        On a team with three of my friends, we competed in the PennApps Hackathon. It was a lot of work with little sleep, but in the end we managed to create a working prototype of our original idea  
                        and ended up winning the Humor Route and Best Machine Learning with Tangram categories. Check out the project on the <a class="link" href="https://devpost.com/software/felipe" target="_blank">Devpost here</a>.

                        When a bot used in a school club's discord server stopped working, I had the fun idea to create my own and enhance on the functionality of the old one. My bot monitors the server channels for 
                        keywords and then generate a response. When no pre-scripted response is available, the message is passed to a GPT-2 large language model to generate a custom response. The project was hosted 24/7 on Heroku
                        until they discontinued their free dynos late 2022.

                        Right after of my first CS class, the general advice I was given was "<em>just create something</em>!". So after wondering what to do for a little bit, decided the first thing to do was create a little game in python.
                        I spent a few days floundering around with the pygame library before settling on making a game found in Eric Matthes <em>Python Crash Course</em>. But I didn't want to make a cookie-cutter copy of what he did, so instead I changed
                        several major ways the game is played. His game is more or less a simplified form of Galaga, while I made mine a sideways-scrolling shooter. Nowadays I would be able to make a much more feature-rich expereince (and who knows, maybe I'll revisit it someday)
                        but at the time it helped me practice OOP techniques and (argueably more importantly) how to read 3rd party documentation. Overall a fun learning expereince and source code can be found on my
