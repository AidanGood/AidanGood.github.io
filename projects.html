                        I had the amazing opportunity to work with Professor Thiago Serra as a part of the Bucknell Advanced Analytics Research Lab.
                        Working with a solid team of 3 other undergradiate students from different diciplines, we all were focused on the topic of looking
                        for biases that can result from compressing artificial neural networks used in machine learning. <br> <br>
                        My main role involed building up the infastructure to be able to train different models using Pytorch, a popular Python machine learning library, 
                        compress them to different pruning ratios, and then record the performance of the models to then determine if any statistically significant 
                        biases could be see. Preliminary results look promising, and I am continuing the work with Professor Serra over the Fall 2021 semester, with an expanded
                        focus of analysing how the model layers change once prunned and if a better method of pruning could be created that will avoid biases being introduced.

                        Together with 3 of my friends, we all applied to compete in the PennApps Hackathon. It was a lot of work with little sleep, but in the end we managed to create a working prototype of our original idea  
                        and ended up winning the Humor Route and Best Machine Learning with Tangram categories. Check out the project on the <a class="link" href="https://devpost.com/software/felipe" target="_blank">Devpost here.</a>

                        When a bot regularly used in a college club's discord server stopped working, I had the fun idea to create my own bot and replicate the functinality of the previous bot. Written in python, the bot monitors chat channels for 
                        keywords that will then cause it to respond. Future plans include incorperating GPT-3 or similar natural language processing APIs. This project is written in python, and hosted 24/7 on Heroku. Overall it was a fun 
                        experience learning a new API (Discord) and figuring out how to remotely host an always-running python script using Heroku.

                        Right after of my first CS class, the general advice I was given was "<em>just create something</em>!". So after wondering what to do for a little bit, decided the first thing to do was create a little game in python.
                        I spent a few days floundering around with the pygame library before settling on making a game found in Eric Matthes <em>Python Crash Course</em>. But I didn't want to make a cookie-cutter copy of what he did, so instead I changed
                        several major ways the game is played. His game is more or less a simplified form of Galaga, while I made mine a sideways-scrolling shooter. Nowadays I would be able to make a much more feature-rich expereince (and who knows, maybe I'll revisit it someday)
                        but at the time it helped me practice OOP techniques and (argueably more importantly) how to read 3rd party documentation. Overall a fun learning expereince and source code can be found on my
