                        My first real foray into the world of FPGAs and hardware synthesis, two of my friends and I created a circuit that replicates 
                        the basics of the Dance Dance Revolution game: a directional arrow appears and you press (or step) on the corresponding directional button.
                        We used the Basys3 Dev Board with Vivado software. Project features include VGA output, NES controller support, and 4 difficulty selection.

                        Working in the Bucknell Advanced Analytics Research Lab, my primary focus was on measuring the impact pruning has on

                        On a team with three of my friends, we competed in the PennApps Hackathon. It was a lot of work with little sleep, but in the end we managed to create a working prototype of our original idea  
                        and ended up winning the Humor Route and Best Machine Learning with Tangram categories. Check out the project on the <a class="link" href="https://devpost.com/software/felipe" target="_blank">Devpost here.</a>

                        When a server bot used in a club's discord server stopped working, I had the fun idea to create my own and enhance on the functionality of the old one. My bot monitors the server channels for 
                        keywords that will generate a response. When no pre-scripted response is available, the message is passed to a GPT-2 natural language model to generate a custom response. The project is hosted 24/7 on Heroku.

                    <p>
                        Right after of my first CS class, the general advice I was given was "<em>just create something</em>!". So after wondering what to do for a little bit, decided the first thing to do was create a little game in python.
                        I spent a few days floundering around with the pygame library before settling on making a game found in Eric Matthes <em>Python Crash Course</em>. But I didn't want to make a cookie-cutter copy of what he did, so instead I changed
                        several major ways the game is played. His game is more or less a simplified form of Galaga, while I made mine a sideways-scrolling shooter. Nowadays I would be able to make a much more feature-rich expereince (and who knows, maybe I'll revisit it someday)
                        but at the time it helped me practice OOP techniques and (argueably more importantly) how to read 3rd party documentation. Overall a fun learning expereince and source code can be found on my
