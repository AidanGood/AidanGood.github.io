                        I had the amazing opportunity to work with Professor Thiago Serra as a part of the Bucknell Advanced Analytics Research Lab.
                        Working with a solid team of 3 other undergradiate students from different diciplines, we all were focused on the topic of looking
                        for biases that can result from compressing artificial neural networks used in machine learning. <br> <br>
                        My main role involed building up the infastructure to be able to train different models using Pytorch, a popular Python machine learning library, 
                        compress them to different pruning ratios, and then record the performance of the models to then determine if any statistically significant 
                        biases could be see. Preliminary results look promising, and I am continuing the work with Professor Serra over the Fall 2021 semester, with an expanded
                        focus of analysing how the model layers change once prunned and if a better method of pruning could be created that will avoid biases being introduced.<br> <br> <br>

                    <p>
                        Together with 3 of my friends, we all applied to compete in the PennApps Hackathon. It was a lot of work with little sleep, but in the end we managed to create a working prototype of our original idea  
                        and ended up winning the Humor Route category. Check out the project on the <a class="link" href="https://devpost.com/software/felipe" target="_blank">Devpost here.</a>
