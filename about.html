                        I'm an ASIC Design Engineer at Ericsson, and graduated from Bucknell University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

                    <p class="bubble">
                        I'm an Eagle Scout, and still enjoy going on hikes or backpacking. I have been playing tennis for a few years, and I used to run XC. 
                        Made it to states in high school, but haven't run competetively since then.<br>
                        I primarily play singleplayer and coop games, got a Quest 2 for beatsaber and other VR games. <br>
                        I listen to tech-focused podcasts, such as the WAN Show and Broken Silicon, to keep
                        up-to-date with current consumer news. <br>
                        I also like coming up with fun projects I could do in my spare time, but have yet to follow through on a lot of them. But who doesn't?

                    <p class="bubble">
                        I primarily program in Python or C, depending on what I am trying to do. I'd say I'm pretty intermediate with both of those languages. 
                        I have coded with Bash, C++, Java, Swift, and other more esoteric languages and can use them but they aren't my "bread and butter" languages. 
                        <br> <br>
                        I'm a bit of an electronics hobbiest, I've worked with simple components (think resistors, caps, leds, switches, etc.) and 74xx ICs. 
                        I have a raspberry pi 3b+, arduino uno, ESP32 dev board, and a basys 3 fpga.
                        <br> <br>
                        I can read component datasheets, have very basic soldering skills, and would consider myself very proficient at knowing <i>how</i> 
                        to use google and new for 2023 chatGPT to search for information. 
                        <br> <br>
                        If this website is anything to go by I clearly am not much for graphic design, although after 3 or 4 complete re-designs I think 
                        this is an ok balance of simple while still being a step above pure-HTML.
