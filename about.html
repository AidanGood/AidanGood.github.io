                    <p>
                        I'm from the Philadelphia area and am a Computer Science and Engineering Major at Bucknell University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the summer of 2020 I worked in retail, where I gained experience in working with a diverse team, 
                        performing tasks on my own initiative, and overall had a great time with a good team lead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the summer of 2021, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Thiago Serra. More information can be found
                        in my <a href="projects.html#summer_research">Projects section here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="Chapter">Skill Set</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am comfortable using Python, C, and Java, with confidence in that order.<br>
                        I am familiar with Java, Swift, RISC-V and C++ with confidence in that order. <br>
                        I am a beginner with HTML5 and CSS3, used in the creation of this website. <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have used Git/Github and have a basic understanding of version control. <br>
                        I am a vim user, but primarily use JetBrains IDEs, VSC, and XCode depeding on which I find best suited for the project. <br>
                        I have a basic understanding of Windows and Unix systems. I currently use macOS and Pop!_OS (an Ubuntu distro) regularly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have had a decent introduction to applied statistics and probability having taken: Engineering and Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, and Econometrics. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="Chapter">My Hobbies Outside Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was a cross country runner, and currently play tennis when I can. I enjoy the outdoors going hiking and backpacking. I've lead a crew of 11 other people 
                        for 14 days in the wilderness of New Mexico on a super fun backpacking trip. I am also an Eagle Scout. <br>
                        I also enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction novels. Some less well known picks of mine would be: The Wheel of Time series, Reboot, and Old Man's War.
