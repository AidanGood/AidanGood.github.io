                        I'm a senior Computer Science and Engineering student, working at the Bucknell Advanced Analytics Research Lab as a Research Assistant.

                    <h3 id="Chapter">Some Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm an Eagle Scout, and still enjoy going on hikes or backpacking. I have been playing tennis for a few years. <br>
                        I have a Quest 2 and like playing VR games like Beatsaber. <br>
                        I listen to tech-focused podcasts, such as the WAN Show and Broken Silicon, to keep
                        up-to-date with current consumer tech news.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="Chapter">Some Skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        I primarily program in Python or C, depending on what I am trying to do. I'd say I'm pretty intermediate with both of those languages. I have coded with Java, Swift, C++, Haskell, and others, but those aren't my "bread and butter".<br> <br>
                        I'm a bit of an electronics hobbiest, I've worked with simple components (think resistors, caps, leds, switches, etc.) and 74xx ICs, have a raspberry pi 3b+, arduino uno, ESP32 dev board, and a basys 3 fpga.<br>
                        I have read component datasheets, have very basic soldering skills, and would consider myself very proficient at knowing <i>how</i> to use google to search for information, possibly one of the most important skills in today's day and age. <br>
                        <br>
                        If this website is anything to go by I clearly am not much for graphic design, although after 3 or 4 complete re-designs I think this is an ok balance of simple while still being a step above pure-HTML.

                    <p>
                        A collection of <a href="subpages/weblinks.html">blogs and webpages</a> I've found scattered around the web that I like to keep listed.
