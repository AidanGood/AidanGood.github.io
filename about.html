                    <p>

                    <p>
                        I use Git/Github and have a beginner understanding of version control. <br>
                        I am a Vim user, but primarily use JetBrains IDEs, VSC, or XCode depeding on which I find best suited for the project. <br>

                    <h3 id="Chapter">My Hobbies Outside Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was a cross country runner, and currently play tennis when I can. I enjoy the outdoors going hiking and backpacking. I've lead a crew of 11 other people 
                        for 14 days in the wilderness of New Mexico on a super fun backpacking trip. I am also an Eagle Scout. <br>
                        I also enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction novels. Some less well known picks of mine would be: The Wheel of Time series, Reboot, and Old Man's War.
