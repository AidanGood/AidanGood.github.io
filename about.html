                    <h3 id="Chapter">Intro</h3>
                    <p>
                        From Philadelphia and am currently a Sophmore Computer Science and Engineering Major at Bucknell University.<br>
                        In addition to CS, I am pursuing Mathematics and Economics Minors. <br> <br>
                        My passion for CS was sparked in HS while reading <a class="link" href="https://www.hackaday.com" target="_blank">Hack-a-day</a> articles, and soon after I was 
                        learning to code in C++ with an arduino UNO board. <br><br>
                        Nowadays I am having fun learning more both through my traditional classes as well as self-teaching. <br> <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="Chapter">Coding Set</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am proficient in Python and Java, using both regularly.<br>
                        I am familiar with Swift, C, RISC-V and C++ , with proficiency in that order.<br>
                        And of course HTML5 and CSS3, used in the creation of this website. <br> <br>
                        Currently I am teaching myself Swift with the goal of eventually creating and publishing an app, <br>
                        And my current CS classes are focused on low-level coding and assembly, with C and RISC-V being the languages used there.<br> <br> <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="Chapter">My Hobbies Outside Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy coding, especially the problem solving aspect of it. However, I do need the occasional break from the laptop: <br> <br>
                        I've played many sports growing up and throughout high school, but currently I try to regularly play tennis <br>
                        I was also a cross country runner growing up, and while no longer on any teams I still enjoy running for fun. <br> 
                        Growing up I was involved heavily in scouting, and I am an Eagle Scout and can attribute lots of leadership skills and experience to that.<br><br>
                        Outside of sports and activities I enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction novels, reading tech websites like Hack-a-day and Notebookcheck, <br>
                        as well as trying to stay enformed in modern events. <br>
