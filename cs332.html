                            This first week was spent setting up the Espressif ESP32-S2 and accompanying ESP-IDF software, as well as contemplating what the "Internet of Things" is.
                            By the end of the week I had managed to run the included "hello_world" program from the VSC extension. <br> <br> The Internet of Things is a pretty big buzzword
                            nowadays, but the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> I think does 
                            a decent job at providing a definition that we can use: "The (IoT) describes physical objects that are embedded with sensors, processing ability,
                            software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks".
                            Looking around there are many different sub-categories that we can apply this to, but mainly we'll be sticking with consumer-focused products and 
                            solutions. Think smart thermostats and smart toasters. Small items where adding this can add convience to everyday items people use regularly.<br>

                            This week was spent diving into the preipherals of this board.<br>
                            First thing this week was to take a look at the included <span class="code">led_strip_main</span> program. Whoever wrote that code probably did so with malicious intent, as it 
                            is way too bright and flashes way too fast to look at. Immediately I modified the brightness down from <span class="code">100</span> to a more manageble <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 17px;">5</span>. 
                            After this I messed around with the timing, and ended up removing <span class="code">strip->clear(strip, 50);</span> to stop the RGB from rapidly flashing.
                             I also lowered the color shift amount to make the color transition smoother. <br>

                            <br>
                            After this I moved onto taking a look at the GPIO pins. <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html?highlight=gpio_config_t#" target="_blank">Here it is in the Espressif documentation</a>.
                            By studying both the provided gpio example code and documentation, I have learned about how to properly configure the pins and I will outline the process: <br>
                            The <span class="code">gpio_config()</span> function is what configures the GPIO pins, and takes a <span class="code">gpio_config_t</span> struct that sets the pin's Mode, Pull-Up/Pull-Down, and interrupt type.
                            <br> To select which pins the desired functions are applied to, a bit mask is given where each bit represents a specific pin. To do this, simply bit left shift by the pin number on an unsigned long long 1 (64 bits) to get the target pin. <br>
                            Example: <span class="code">(1ULL&lt;&lt;14)</span> will make a bit mask that targets pin 14. To target multiple pins use | (the OR operator) between each individual bit mask to get the 
                            final bit mask targeting all wanted pins. It's really just some simple bit logic.<br>
                            Once the <span class="code">gpio_config_t</span> struct is all set to the desired values, pass the address of the struct to <span class="code">gpio_config()</span> will apply those settings to the targeted pins. <br>
                            To set the input pin's interrupt type (what kind of input will trigger an interrupt) you use the <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html?highlight=gpio_config_t#_CPPv418gpio_set_intr_type10gpio_num_t15gpio_int_type_t" target="_blank"><span class="code">gpio_set_intr_type()</span></a> function.
                            The documentation is clear on how to use this in my opinion, and contains links to the different interrupt types. <br>
                            Since multiple GPIO interrupts can occur at the same time, or during a previous interrupt event, it is a good idea to create a queue so that
                            none of these accidentally get ignored. This is done by the following line of code: <span class="code">gpio_evt_queue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(uint32_t));</span>. Here's a quick doc link to <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/system/freertos.html?highlight=xqueuecreate#c.xQueueCreate">xQueueCreate()</a>. <br>
                            In addition to the queue, we can now set up a thread to handle the tasks we want to occur once a GPIO interrupt occurs. <span class="code">xTaskCreate(gpio_task_example, "gpio_task_example", 2048, NULL, 10, NULL);</span>. Here's the <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/system/freertos.html?highlight=xtaskcreate#_CPPv411xTaskCreate14TaskFunction_tPCKcK8uint32_tPCv11UBaseType_tPC12TaskHandle_t">xTaskCreate()</a> doc. <br>
                            However, we need to hook the GPIO interrupts to the ISR, so that they... interrupt. Kinda important they get handled. This is handled with 3 different functions: <br>
                            <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html?highlight=gpio_install_isr_service#_CPPv424gpio_install_isr_servicei" target="_blank"><span class="code">gpio_install_isr_service()</span></a> which sets up some stuff that is not important enough to know right now. <br>
                            <span class="code">gpio_isr_handler_add()</span> which is done to hook a pin. <br>
                            And <span class="code">gpio_isr_handler_remove()</span> to remove a pin. <br>
                            Docs for these are right below the doc section for the <span class="code">gpio_install_isr_service()</span>. <br>
                            <br> Once all of this is done, it is time to throw together the <span class="code">while(1)</span> loop, which is where you tell the output pins what to output.
                            This is done with <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3.2/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html?highlight=gpio_set_level#_CPPv414gpio_set_level10gpio_num_t8uint32_t" target="_blank"><span class="code">gpio_set_level()</span></a>. And that's all there is to configuring the GPIO pins.
                            <br> For our future presentation my group decided to work on the <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/touch_pad.html#introduction" target="_blank">touch sensor</a>.

                            Week 3 is primarily focused on learning about the touch capabilities. <a class="link" href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/api-reference/peripherals/touch_pad.html" target="_blank">Here it is in the Espressif documentation</a>.<br>
                            The touch sensor uses pins 1 - 14, and measures the "capacitance" of the object touching those pins. Using this, you can then determine if they are being pressed, and for how long.
                             Since it measures all 14 pins independantly, this gives a lot of flexibility in setting up a matrix for ~112 unique buttons, or creatingt a sliding touch sensor. 
                            <h3>Code</h3>
                            The example file is located in <span class="code">esp/esp-idf/examples/peripherals/touch_pad_read</span>. <br>
                            The touch sensor has minimal setup. First you need to initialize all the pins wanted. Then you need to set the default sensor settings, which is outlined in the document. This is the High/Low voltage and cycle time for the plates. Then you 
                            can optionally have a denoising setting to counteract any unintentional noise. After this just starting the clock, and creating the task to run the touch sensor code is all that is needed.
                             With <span class="code">touch_pad_read_raw_data()</span> to get the raw data, you can set up a baseline value for touch vs non-touch, as well as logic to determine different touches based on time held.
                             <br> <br>There is another example file is located in <span class="code">esp/esp-idf/examples/peripherals/touch_pad_interrupt</span>. <br>
                            Believe it or not this one show how to make touches cause an interrupt. Compared to the other code example, this one sends an interrupt when a specific pin is touched. This allows for logic to be created around different 
                            key presses. Our group worked on making different sounds with different button presses. 

                            <h3>Figuring out how it really works</h3>
                            According to the documentation, it measures the "capacitance" to determine if an object is being touched or not, but I think that this does not give enough detail. From playing around with it, I think it works as follows: There are two plates near eachother with known capacitance and these are constantly
                             set alternating voltages, and within a time-frame the total low/high switching is counted (as described in the docs). An electrode connected to the pin is near these plates . As the voltage on the electrode changes, this causes 
                            a change in the electric field of the two plates, which in turn causes the capacitance to change. Something akin to <a class="link" href="https://fieldscale.com/learn-capacitive-sensing/intro-to-capacitive-touch-sensors/" target="_blank">this explination of capacitance</a> except 
                            instead of a finger it's the changing voltage that causes changes to the electric field. I find this the most plausible as extending a pin out with a wire so that it becomes effectively a mini-antena, and moving RF emmitting devices (cellular phones, etc.) near the wire causes the measured "capacitance" to change for <b>only the pin which has the wire attached</b>. 
                            I believe the wire's voltage is changing due to the presence of RF signals being emmitted from the devices, and this voltage change causes the electice field to change, changing the capacitance. <br> <br> Such a distinction in how this system works is important
                            because, as show by my experimentation, if wires of a non-inconsequental length (> ~10cm) are used between where the actual touching occurs and the board, using it for touch capabilities where a lot of RF noise is present needs to be taken into account. It also shows that 
                            <i>touch</i> isn't what is actually being measured, but the voltage (voltage change?) on the pin is. <br> <br>
                            Some other questionable experimentation done:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Connecting a touch pin to Ground causes the program to crash</li>
                                <li>Connecting a touch pin to another touch pin causes the program to crash </li>
                                <li>Holding wire touching pin, then touching metal computer shell with same finger touching the wire causes an even larger jump in measure "capacitance"</li>
                                <li>Connecting a touch pin to 3.3V pin causes the measurement to absolutely skyrocket</li>
                            </ul>
